## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox, Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at validating inputs. The HTML+CSS part went rather smoothly, faster than expected. As for the JavaScript, I first selected each input manually for validation then later I realized there is too much code repetition and initialized all inputs as an array. The codebase became much more concise but still easy to follow.

### Continued development

After reaching the first fully functional version it's well worth thinking about refactoring, especially in the JS code.
